# Web Security Notes

This repository contains structured notes from hands-on cybersecurity labs and coursework.
The focus is on understanding attack methodology, impact, and remediation rather than publishing exploit code.

Topics include:
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Enumeration techniques
- Authentication and access control issues
- Privilege escalation concepts
- Network and traffic analysis fundamentals

All testing was performed in controlled, intentionally vulnerable environments.
